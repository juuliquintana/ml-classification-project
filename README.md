# ml-classification-model

This repository contains the source code and resources necessary to develop, train, and evaluate a classification model that determines who can be granted a free premium installment plan. The project uses three datasets: main, paid, and address.

## Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to create a classification model to determine who can be granted a free premium installment plan. 

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Scientific computing with arrays.
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualization.

## Main Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Extensive cleaning of the main, paid, and address datasets.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Exploration and visualization of data to better understand its characteristics.
- **Creation of New Columns:** Generation of important new columns from the existing data.
- **Development of Classification Model:** Selection, training, and evaluation of various classification algorithms to determine the best model.
